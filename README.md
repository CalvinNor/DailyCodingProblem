# Daily Coding Problem
A repository to host and get feedback on my solutions to [Daily Coding Problem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/) problems.

Daily Coding Problem is a website for getting daily problems, sourced from the best Software Company interviews like Amazon, Google, Facebook, etc.
You can subscribe to their free daily problems via email, or get problems + solutions via their Premium plan. I recommend you check it out.

### Rules of the Repo
- Always have *readable code* and *good naming conventions*. Hard to read one-liners don't belong here.
- Separate out the pieces of the file. Problem goes at the top, followed by code, followed by test cases.
- Programs should not print or update anything. Functions should return their outputs for assertions.
- Fancy syntax and lambdas should be used *as less as possible*, to make way for readable algorithms.
- Since these are pure algorithmic problems, do not use any libraries.

### Disclaimer *
- I'm a beginner at Python.
- This repository does not copy solutions to any problems.
- All problems on this repo come straight to me via Email, and won't contain any random problems from random websites, unless specified otherwise.
- I've subscribed to the free version of Daily Coding Problem, hence I don't get solutions. I reach for 100% case coverage, but some may not be perfect.
- Collaboration and feedback is most welcome.
